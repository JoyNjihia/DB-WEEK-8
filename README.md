**Library Management System using MySQL**

## 📖 Description

This project is a relational database application built with **MySQL** that models the operations of a typical library. It allows tracking of:

- Authors and the books they've written

- Book loans (who borrowed which book and when)
- Book reviews submitted by members

This system provides a structured way to store and retrieve data relevant to library operations, ensuring referential integrity and supporting various relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).
